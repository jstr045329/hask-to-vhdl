This directory contains Python scripts that you should only 
need to run occasionally, if ever. 

These scripts do 1 of 2 things:
    1) generate the VHDL templates in the VhdTemplates directory, or
    2) convert templates into libraries that Haskell generated code
       assumes the existence of; which go in the VhdLibs directory.
